This version precedes the final one by a few weeks. We were so eager to expose it to your rigorous and nevertheless gracious testing that we indeed decided not to wait until the final version to make it public. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you Dotclear 2.6-RC.</p>



<h3>The set</h3>


<p>Because every show needs an appropriate set, we have entirely repainted the stage. We therefore present you with a new visual identity, together with a set of icons that match the new color scheme:</p>


<p><img src="http://dotclear.org/public/images/2.6/palette-traviata.png" alt="palette-traviata.png" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="palette-traviata.png, Oct 2013" /></p>


<p>We have also taken advantage of this opportunity to create an additional variation to the Blowup theme, Plumetis. Let it be known that our secret plans <del>to take over the world</del> include projects for major improvements in the development and configuration of themes in the next version (2.7).</p>


<h3>Stage direction</h3>


<p>We have also carried on our ameliorations in terms of ergonomics and accessibility. There is still a long way to go—<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php">ATAG</a> and others aren't fully there yet—but we have made a number of noteworthy improvements in this domain.</p>


<p>The administration area will also be easier to use on various supports. Our objective for this version was to drastically improve the usage of the administration on mobile devices and small screens. Mission accomplished! A few pages aren't fully optimized yet, but we will work on them in the future.</p>


<h3>The orchestra</h3>


<p>Dotclear 2.6-RC is brought to you by a beautiful, merry, and prolific team work. We have sustained a few minor storms, but the mood was (almost) always delightfully good. While JcDenis, baby bottle in one hand, kid in the other, and keyboard on his lap was entirely recoding the maintenance and backup interface as well as the management of plugins and themes, nikrou was lovingly cooking up categories and media management in between two javascript implementations. Kozlika was making icons and torturing DOM, CSS, coders and users together. Lipki was aflutter around the widgets, closing ticket after ticket with artistic dexterity; so did sogox and bernardleroux. Dsls delved once again in the deepest of our basements to secure the stage and prepare the shows to come.</p>


<p>Franck Paul directed the whole with the big booming voice of the irrascible and grouchy dictator he ought to be. Cherry on top of this masterful production: a commit by Pep himself!</p>


<p><a href="http://dotclear.org/public/images/2.6/commits.jpg" title="commits.jpg"><img src="http://dotclear.org/public/images/2.6/.commits_m.jpg" alt="commits.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="commits.jpg, Oct 2013" /></a></p>


<p>In the meanwhile, community managers Samantdi, Guillaume, Krazy Kitty (smoothly acknowledging yourself: one of the perks of translation) and Otir were, well, managing the community on the digital waves. Pinkilla, Tomer, Llu_ne, BG, mirovinbien, Jean-Michel, Aide Pour—yes, that's an odd name even for us—, Sacrip'Anne, Lomalarch, Philippe, xave, anthom, Patidou, Tetsuo, Cunégonde, Denis, Gilsoub, Pierre, brol, Armony and others also put their shoulders to the wheel, documenting, testing, animating the mailing list, writing whimsical minutes of our weekly IRC meetings, making coffee, updating the server's Dokuwiki, geolocalizing photos, and much more.</p>


<p>(Now's the point where we realize with utter dread that name-dropping will necessarily result, as we cannot but have forgotten people, in bitter chiding... and a few beers!)</p>


<h3>The singers</h3>


<p>That's you!</p>


<p>We need you to test this version, to <a href="http://dev.dotclear.org/2.0/newticket">report bugs</a>, to help updating <a href="http://fr.dotclear.org/documentation/2.6">the documentation</a>, to report potential translation mistakes (in French, English, and other languages while you're at it), to send us marshmallows.</p>


<p>So, in short: download, install, use, and let us know all about it!</p>


<p>We will publish here, before the final version of 2.6 comes out, more detailed information on the changes brought by this new version, particularly on the code side.</p>


<h3>Overture</h3>


<p>Paa, paa, paa, paa, papam... you can download version 2.6-RC <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/current/dotclear-2.6-RC.zip">here</a>. Avanti la musica \o/</p>

<p>This branch of Dotclear, containing all versions from 2.5 to 2.5.3, will from now on be under maintenance only, mostly to fix critical errors should there be any. Indeed, we are now focusing our efforts on the next "major" version, 2.6, which we plan to release in the coming weeks (ideally in October, but time does fly...).</p>


<p>Regarding this future version, let's just say that we're very impatient to have it out, because it's much sexier than the current one!</p>

";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2013-08-15T19:10:00+02:00";s:2:"TS";i:1376586600;}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:72:"http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story";s:5:"title";s:29:"Dotclear and us, a love story";s:7:"creator";s:11:"Krazy Kitty";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:6832:"<p>It's still August 13 in parts of the world. And I've always liked birthday parties to last a little bit longer. I've already shouted my own personal love for Dotclear <a href="http://amrhaps.net/english/post/2013/08/13/Happy-10-Dotclear">within my own walls</a>, as if becoming part of the team that is the English-speaking window of Dotclear to the world wasn't proof enough. Today, I'm here to tell you more about how it all happened...</p>    <p>The story of Dotclear started ten years (and one day) ago when, on August 13, 2003, Olivier Meunier, a young, promising, fiery and possibly slightly temperamental French developer, <a href="http://neokraft.net/2003/08/13/nouveau-cms" hreflang="fr">shared with the world</a> a piece of software he had written for his own use.</p>


<p>At first, Dotclear is a simple zip file, hosted by Benoît Clair. Support merely consists in exchanging emails with Olivier.
But quickly, interest for Dotclear starts to grow. A mailing list, then a forum appear; the first team is put together. Xave and Kozlika join Olivier and Benoît. Dotclear gains a written documentation and a support forum.</p>


<p>From the start, the goals of the team are clear: helping users, regardless of their computer skills, and leading them to autonomy. They must be able to install their own blog and take control over it without being specialists. Back then, personal weblogs are booming, and multiple online platforms welcome, free of charge, users that are soon disappointed by invading advertising and haphazard maintenance. In contrast, the alternative offered by Dotclear makes it possible to feel entirely at home in your own blog, and to give your readers a visual environment both original and aesthetically pleasing—Kozlika's incredibly refined first themes are miles away from what's then typically done.</p>


<p>Respecting good practices, without limiting their application to those in the technical know; giving accessibility a prime role, so that every and anyone can use Dotclear, including disabled users; united around the same desires and objectives, the team members become a tight group of friends, and this will always remain one of the prime aspects of the project. One day, a ten-year old boy writes to the forum to say he used Dotclear to open his blog on his favorite topic: firefighters. The team tells themselves they've managed alright.</p>


<p>Bloggers of all kinds have adopted Dotclear. Big names like Tristan Nitot, then president of Mozilla Europe<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story#pnote-988-1" id="rev-pnote-988-1">1</a>]</sup>, or Daniel Glazman, chairman of the CSS Working Group of W3C<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story#pnote-988-2" id="rev-pnote-988-2">2</a>]</sup>. No-names that would soon become big names, like Maître Eolas<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story#pnote-988-3" id="rev-pnote-988-3">3</a>]</sup>. And, above all, you, me, and all the others.</p>


<p>Along the years, how many blog notes written, read, passionately commented, in a frenzy! In the French-speaking world, Dotclear pages have been the theater of <a href="http://www.obni.net/dotclear2/?post/2006/11/13/870-kozlika-ou-l-art-d-etre-communicative" hreflang="fr">great friendships</a>, <a href="http://traou.net/blog/index.php?post/2006/03/12/91-ballade-de-jim-1-jim-en-bretagne" hreflang="fr">crushes</a>, <a href="http://sacripanne.net/post/2011/12/12/J-aime-le-voir-jouer" hreflang="fr">love</a>, <a href="http://soindesoi.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/01/17/Maternité" hreflang="fr">births</a>, <a href="http://open-time.net/post/2012/06/06/Aujourd-hui-un-jeu" hreflang="fr">the premature departures of beloved buddies</a>, <a href="http://lasoeurkaramazov.net/post/2013/04/08/Café-solidaire-et-frites-charitable" hreflang="fr">long discussions</a>, <a href="http://bricablog.net/dotclear/index.php/post/2005/05/04/522-ce-blog-ne-croit-pas-en-dieu" hreflang="fr">controverses</a>, <a href="http://www.kozlika.org/kozeries/post/2010/01/10/Les-bonnes-recettes-de-Maame-Kozlika-partie-2-%3A-la-galette" hreflang="fr">fits of laughter</a>, <a href="http://xave.org/post/2008/10/18/deception" hreflang="fr">disappointments</a>, <a href="http://www.mirovinben.com/blog/index.php?pages/Chic-des-Clics" hreflang="fr">beautiful pictures</a>, and <a href="http://archives.lanternebrisee.net/post/2013/04/20/Opéra%2C-premier-tableau" hreflang="fr">awe</a>. Or, in other words, life.</p>


<p>Year after year, the team grew bigger. Some had less time to give to the projects, others joined: Pep, Biou and Franck Paul have left the imprint of their personalities on Dotclear, while respecting its fundamental principles, for as the Prince of Salina in <em>The Leopard</em>, they knew that "if we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change".</p>


<p>Dotclear remains a free (as in both beer and speech) software, supported by a team of passionate volunteers with a little touch of madness. Currently, projects abound and here's what's being discussed on the mailing list:</p>
<ul>
<li>soon, very soon, so soon that it's actually already here, version 2.5.2;</li>
<li>fresh looks for the Dotclear and Dotaddict websites;</li>
<li>more and more improvements in terms of ergonomics, accessibility, and good practices;</li>
<li>a richer, more flexible editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even when you don't understand (or read) half the messages on the mailing list, it's fantastic to see so much activity around Dotclear. Users, including silent, anonymous, unknown users we've never met, stay at the heart of the team's concerns, and this warms my cold, cold heart.</p>


<p>We have no doubt that in the future Dotclear will become such a sexy, ergonomic and powerful engine that our friend <a href="http://embruns.net/logbook/2013/07/09.html#dotclear-2003-2013-rip" hreflang="fr">Laurent Gloaguen</a>, who loves to tease us about our imminent death and pretends to hate felines, will move his blog to Dotclear and, in the same swift move, adopt a cat. This remains, after all, our true main goal.</p>

<p>In this new version you'll find: bug fixes, cosmetic improvements, a better quality of thumbnails in the media manager, and, most of all, the replacement of the old Flash multiple media upload thingie by another thingie that does exactly the same but in Ajax and without any security vulnerability.</p>

Quite a lot has happened in the Dotclear community recently. Let me try to sum it all up for you.</p>


<p>On July 9th, <a href="http://open-time.net/">Franck</a>, who had been in charge of Dotclear since February, around the time when version 2.5 came out, decided to leave and slam the door on his way out.</p>


<p>While he was full of hopes, projects and enthusiasm, the community didn't follow. Team members, from lack of either time or eagerness, were less and less available. The new projects he announced (redesign the admin interface, replace the wysiwyg editor by something more advanced, give the Dotclear and Dotaddict websites a fresh look...) weren't enough to drive the team. Most of all, Franck missed what was for him the most important in Dotclear: the conviviality and team spirit. So Franck was quitting, and what would happen to Dotclear?</p>


<p>The door slamming certainly did one thing: suddenly, the community awoke.</p>


<p>People started talking, on Twitter and the Dotclear blog more particularly. On July 10th, <a href="http://www.kozlika.org/kozeries/">Kozlika</a> started outlining three possible futures for the project.</p>


<p>The first possibility is that a number of new, motivated and energetic developers (and, more generally speaking, contributors of all sorts) join Dotclear. The problem hasn't so much to do with money, marketing or communication, but mostly with contributions. With a vibrant community, there is no doubt that Dotclear can find its second wind.</p>


<p>The second possibility is to focus on simply keeping Dotclear afloat. No major changes, no projects for new features, simply a small team of developers, testers and webmasters devoted to fixing bugs and updating the code with new versions of PHP.</p>


<p>The third possibility is to slowly move to a close. Take the time (one or two years) to help users migrate towards new solutions, to ask the developers of other CMS for migration plugins, and so forth. This only requires a small team of people, with few programming skills, for a short time.</p>


<p>Then Kozlika opened the discussion on the dev mailing list. Everyone, independently of skills, was invited to join. Dozens and dozens of people did. Hundreds of messages were exchanged. Looks like Dotclear's not quite dead yet...</p>


<p>... And, indeed, we're releasing a new version !</p>


<p>Thanks to the wonderful community, changes are coming. Stay tuned for further updates!</p>";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2013-07-21T23:31:00+02:00";s:2:"TS";i:1374442260;}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:53:"http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5";s:5:"title";s:12:"Dotclear 2.5";s:7:"creator";s:6:"Franck";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:3398:"    <p>As stated in our <a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/02/24/Upcoming-2.5">Dotclear 2.5 Release Candidate announcement</a>, this one mainly sees the thightening of bolts and screws everywhere, and dozens of tickets (say : a lot) closed (don't worry, we kept a few, thus there's still work to be done), some of them long overdue, whatever the reasons.</p>


<p>Among the differences beetween our RC and this release: a couple of bugs have been fixed, and more importantly, we had to fix two security issue comming from the multiple files upload system we're using. We are now planning to replace this (Flash) component by a new one, in Ajax. Expect a 2.5.1 one of these days. :)</p>


<p>The new version is, as usual, available there : <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/latest.zip">http://download.dotclear.org/latest.zip</a></p>


<p>Let me use my very first annoucement as the new skipper to talk you about a few things I would like to see being worked on in the near future<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5#pnote-971-1" id="rev-pnote-971-1">1</a>]</sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The revamping of the back-office should benefit from the work currently under progress on the <q>sexy</q> branch, which now includes <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>, in order to make administration of your blog even more friendly and powerful.</li>
<li>Still in the back-office, it would be nice to replace the "wysiwyg" editor by something like <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a>. It is a big job, and we've had so far some unsuccessful trials... well, it is a bit of a holy grail but it would be cool to have that.</li>
<li>Make some room for Dotclear 2 by moving Dotclear 1 closer to the attic on Dotclear and DotAddict websites, and harmonise a bit their designs.</li>
<li>Progressively abandon PHP versions lower than 5.2<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5#pnote-971-2" id="rev-pnote-971-2">2</a>]</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The main idea is to streamline Dotclear to the essential stuff and to externalise everything else in plugins (this is what the <q>sexy</q> branch is all about), to use whatever libraries others do better than we do (a template system, a wysiwyg editor, ...) in order to ease future developments. That being said, such deep changes might have a cost in terms of compatibility, but those questions will be dealt with at the right place, in the right time, we're not there yet.</p>


<p>If ever you're reading this English version of the announcement, it surely means you're a bit too far away for that, but if you have the occasion, feel free to follow <a href="http://fr.dotclear.org/blog/" hreflang="fr">the French blog</a>, where we plan to give details about a meet-up in Paris somewhere next month.</p>

";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2013-03-16T01:42:00+01:00";s:2:"TS";i:1363394520;}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:53:"http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/02/24/Upcoming-2.5";s:5:"title";s:32:"Upcoming 2.5 (and a bit of news)";s:7:"creator";s:4:"xave";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:2625:"    <p>Today nearly sees the release of Dotclear 2.5: what we release today is a Release Candidate, meaning that we hope it's the real deal, but we'd like it to be tested by a few madmen before releasing it in the wild in a few days.</p>


<p>Why this waryness? We've had a big crash on Dotclear sister server: Dotaddict.org, and we had to stop everything to reinstall it from scratch, and I mean nearly really from scratch, as we discovered in the process that our backup plan hasn't been working for several months (and let that be a warning: automation is good, as long as you automatize some checks in the process.)</p>


<p>And because we had to stop working on that nearly finished 2.5, we prefer now to introduce it slowly, just to be on the safe side.</p>


<p>Users won't find any big changes in it: webfonts can now be used in Ductile and the daInstaller plugin is included in the main release. Other than that, there have been a whole bunch of small changes, both functional and cosmetic. Changes two are to be found for themes and plugins builders, and we can't even count all the small bugs that were fixed. As important for sysadmins: we are confident that Dotclear is now PHP5.4 compatible, for people using top-notch hosting.</p>


<p>Another important bit of news: having got a new job for the last 18 months, I finally had to admit that my schedule doesn't allow me to manage the project any more. It was really becoming a burden and a problem for the project, as I had often had no time to dwell into things. As nobody wants things to stall, waiting for my decisions or approvals, it became important to allow someone else to make those decisions, even if I stay in the team.</p>


<p>That's why we now welcome Franck Paul as the new project manager. It was an easy choice, as Franck not only is an historic member of the Dotclear Team, but is also the guy behind that new release, fixing most of the bugs single-handedly and driving the team for changes. Dotclear won't change: albeit with a role re-distribution, that's still the same team working on it.</p>


<p>And working we are, we're already working on several projects, stay tuned.</p>


<p>Do I forget something? Yep, the 2.5RC: it's now available in the nightlies at <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/nightly/dotclear-2.5-RC-r1105.zip" title="http://download.dotclear.org/nightly/dotclear-2.5-RC-r1105.zip">http://download.dotclear.org/nightl...</a>, or by defining DC_UPDATE_VERSION to "testing" in your configuration file, if you want to take advantage of the autoupdate feature.

But it calls for a small celebration, so here are three things:</p>


<p>We're starting with a new release. Dotclear 2.4.4 is mostly a bugfix release and you shouldn't notice any difference.

<p>In order to clear the backlog of things we'd like not to think about any more: the DC Loader, the script that allows you to install Dotclear in three clicks, has been updated, is now prettier, and is localization ready (only English and French are available, for now, though.)

<p>Last but not least, a small pre-announcement: the team has started to work on a Dotclear version nicknamed "Sexy". It should coexist for a while with the good old official one and aims to rewrite a good part of its internals in order to be lighter, quicker, sexier!

<ul>
<li>Some internal clean-up for development files that were preventing a clean upgrade under unusual circumstances.</li>
<li>Localisation problems have been corrected for our new dashboard system.</li>
<li>Cleaning and refining for some CSS &amp; JS files.</li>
<li>There were a problem with the user preferences in the import/export module. This has been corrected.</li>
<li>You can now configure the email address used to send password reminders.</li>
<li>A potential security flaw has been fixed + some others security tightening.</li>
</ul>

<p>About the last two points:</p>


<p>Starting with this version, the email address for reminders is set up in the config file. On new installations, a default one will be defined. For security reasons, it will not be the case with upgrades. Please add the following line to your inc.config.php file:</p>

<pre>
define('DC_ADMIN_MAILFROM','dotclear@theaddressyouwant.com');
</pre>


<p>If you don't do so, Dotclear will work as usual. You'll just raise the password reminders mails' score in antispam system.</p>



<p>About the security fix and tightening: you don't have to worry about the tightening, we just enhanced the security for the software's future life. There is a true security flaw, though, that could have been used under certain rare circumstances to gain access to a administrator account. You are still encouraged to update, better safe than sorry.</p>


<p>Those security enhancements were indicated by Jérémie Boutoille, while he was participating in <a href="http://www.pirate-moi.com/" hreflang="fr" title="Pirate-Moi">Pirate-Moi</a>, a monthly hacking contest that chose Dotclear for its last edition.</p>

<p>Here comes the brand new Dotclear 2.3.

<li>A new safe mode, for those cases where a plugin locks you out;</li>
<li>A new configurable side menu.</li>
